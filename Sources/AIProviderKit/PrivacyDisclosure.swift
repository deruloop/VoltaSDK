//  PrivacyDisclosure.swift
//  AIProviderKit
//
//  Disclosure of privacy downgrades during fallback.
//
//  Why this exists already on iOS 26: with `.preferOnDevice`, a transient
//  failure of the on-device model silently re-sends the user's prompt to an
//  external provider (OpenAI). That privacy downgrade happens TODAY, not
//  only on iOS 27. The mechanism deliberately matches the iOS 27 design
//  (.silent / .notify / .askOnPrivacyChange), so the extension won't
//  change the API.
//
//  Only the developer knows their app's sensitivity: that's why the policy
//  is a configuration choice, not a hardcoded default.
