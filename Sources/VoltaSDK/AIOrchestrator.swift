//
//  AIOrchestrator.swift
//  VoltaSDK
//
//  The orchestrator and the stable public API.
//  On iOS 26 it resolves between two providers (on-device + developer key)
//  with automatic fallback and privacy disclosure. The same public surface
//  will carry iOS 27, which adds PCC, user-account providers, and the
//  per-need chain (.lightweight / .reasoning / .largeContext).
//
//  Naming note: the type is NOT named after the module (VoltaSDK)
//  because in Swift a type that shadows its own module makes it impossible
//  to qualify other symbols (`VoltaSDK.Xyz` would always resolve the
//  type, never the module). "Orchestrator" also reflects the framework's
//  real value: model resolution, not agent execution.
