## 1. TL;DR — what this is

VoltaSDK (**VOLTA** = *Versatile Orchestration Layer for Tiered AI*; named
after Alessandro Volta — battery = stacked cells = fallback chain) is a
Swift Package that **resolves
which AI model to use** at runtime (on-device Foundation Models vs a
vendor-agnostic developer key — OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini — today; PCC and
user-account providers on iOS 27) with
automatic fallback, privacy disclosure, transcript-transparent conversations,
and token awareness. It does **not** invent an agent abstraction — on iOS 27
it *feeds* Apple's native Dynamic Profiles rather than wrapping them. One
stable public API across all phases (SemVer: 0.x during development; **1.0.0
is reserved for the complete feature set, including iOS 27**).

## 2. Documentation map

| Artifact | Audience | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | public (GitHub) | what it is, **version support tiers (26.0 / 26.4 / 27)**, SPM installation, usage, demos |
| `docs/iOS26-Implementation.md` | internal | how the **shipped** iOS 26 + 26.4 tiers are implemented: file map, decisions D4–D5, D7–D13, D15, stable API, verification, troubleshooting |
| `docs/iOS27-Design.md` | internal | how iOS 27 **will** be implemented: decisions D1–D3, D6, D14, capability split, provider table, mapping, implementation order |
| `docs/iOS27-OpenQuestions.md` | internal, temporary | Q1–Q17 gating iOS 27 work; answers get merged into the design doc, then this file is deleted |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | public | SemVer release notes |

Rule of thumb: change shipped code → update the iOS 26 doc; take an iOS 27
decision → update the design doc; learn an iOS 27 answer → move it from the
questions doc into the design doc; release → CHANGELOG + state here.

## 3. Current state (June 2026)

- **Versioning policy (user decision, June 2026): 1.0.0 is reserved for the
  complete feature set, including iOS 27.** The earlier 1.0.0/1.0.1/2.0.0
  tags were deleted (never pushed anywhere); current release line is **0.x**,
  starting at `0.1.0`. During 0.x, minor versions may evolve the API.
- **iOS 26 / 26.4: fully working — v0.3.5** (tags `0.1.0`–`0.3.5`,
  2026-06-12/13; 0.2.0 = vendor-agnostic developer key D15, 0.3.0 = collapsed
  ModelSelector with `.activate/.deny/.deferred` selection responses,
  0.3.1 = docs-only, 0.3.2 = ModelSelector gate invariant — never preselects
  gated providers, auto-selects on-device only, through `onSelection`,
  0.3.3 = docs-only: **builds require Xcode 26.4+** / runs on 26.0+,
  learned from an adopter's CI failure,
  0.3.4 = docs-only: public README stripped of iOS 27 forward-references
  (design docs keep them; nothing iOS 27 is implemented),
  0.3.5 = docs-only: real repo URL in the SPM snippet).
  **0.3.5 is the stable iOS 26 line and the designated Xcode-26.4 anchor**
  (the last release that compiles with Xcode 26.4 — the iOS 27 line will
  require Xcode 27).
  41 tests in 8 suites green; builds verified on macOS 26.5, iOS 26.5
  simulator, and signed for a physical iPhone. First adoption in the author's
  app is in progress. The 26.4 token-aware tier lights up by itself at
  runtime; on 26.0–26.3 context handling stays reactive-only, by design.
- **iOS 27: implementation STARTED on `xcode27` (June 2026).** The hard gate
  is cleared — Xcode 27 beta (27A5209h) + iOS 27.0 SDK are installed at
  `/Applications/Xcode-beta.app` (build with
  `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer swift build|test`;
  the machine's default `xcode-select` is still Command Line Tools). The
  package builds and tests green on the beta (Swift 6.4, macOS 27 SDK on the
  host, **89 tests in 19 suites** as of the per-need chains). First
  provider shipped on the branch:
  **`PrivateCloudComputeProvider`** (`@available(iOS 27, *)`, wired into
  `buildProviders` at one gate per D14, default-on via
  `enablePrivateCloudCompute`, placed between on-device and the developer key
  in the two `prefer` chains). **Validated end-to-end on the M2 host (macOS 27):
  with the entitlement assigned to the account, PCC answers live at privacy
  `appleCloud`.** Key runtime findings folded in: the required entitlement is
  `com.apple.developer.private-cloud-compute` (developer-side; requested via
  Apple's form, Small Business Program + <2M downloads); `availability` is NOT
  entitlement-aware and a missing entitlement *traps* (uncatchable) on first
  `respond`, so the provider gates on a `SecTask` self-check and degrades to a
  graceful skip (matters because PCC is default-on — adopting VoltaSDK never
  forces the entitlement). High-priority open questions answered from the SDK
  and folded into `docs/iOS27-Design.md` §8 (Q1–Q7, Q9–Q11, Q14); what remains
  (`docs/iOS27-OpenQuestions.md`: Q8, Q12–Q13, Q15–Q17) needs external accounts,
  a separate package, or more runtime poking — not API shape.
- **Demos restructured (June 2026): one signed Xcode app per platform.**
  Dropped the unsigned `swift run VoltaSDKDemo` executable (a `swift run` binary
  can't carry the PCC entitlement) and added **`Examples/macOSDemo`** — the
  signed macOS twin of `Examples/iOSDemo`, same shared `VoltaSDKDemoUI` chat UI.
  Both treat PCC as **opt-in** (build for everyone, PCC unavailable; enable live
  PCC by adding the capability with your own entitled team). The transitional
  `Examples/macOSPCCTest` was folded into `macOSDemo`. **XcodeGen 2.33 caveat:**
  it emits local packages as a legacy folder reference that Xcode 27 rejects
  ("Missing package product"); both demo `.xcodeproj` are hand-patched to use
  `XCLocalSwiftPackageReference` and are the source of truth — re-apply that fix
  if you regenerate.
- **1.0.0 RELEASED (Sep 12, 2026): `xcode27` merged into `main`; `main` is
  now the 1.0 line.** Tagged on the merge commit (pre-release marker `0.9.0`
  tagged the day before, on the branch tip). Released against the beta
  toolchain 27A5237l; the GA re-verify of every §8-derived claim is still
  owed and ships as a patch if anything shifted. Next work happens on the
  **`evaluation`** branch (roadmap item 11), created from 1.0.0.
- **Git: remote is `https://github.com/deruloop/VoltaSDK.git` (public).**
  Branching strategy (user decision, June 2026 — **executed Sep 12, 2026**):
  - **`main`** = the iOS 26 line. Stays at `0.3.x` (now `0.3.5`), builds on
    Xcode 26.4+, runs on iOS 26+. Public README describes only this.
  - **`xcode27`** (pushed, currently identical to `main`) = the iOS 27 work.
    Requires Xcode 27 (iOS 27 SDK); `@available(iOS 27, *)` so it still
    deploys to iOS 26+. **Merged into `main` when iOS 27 ships (~September),
    at which point `main` becomes the `1.0` line.** Periodically sync
    `main → xcode27` to avoid drift. Its README will advertise the Xcode 27
    requirement and point Xcode-26.4 users to pin `0.3.5`.
  - Toolchain note (settled): no `#if canImport` gymnastics needed. The
    iOS-27 release simply *requires Xcode 27 to build* (documented like the
    26.4 note); `@available` handles runtime; deployment target stays iOS 26;
    adopters on older Xcode pin to `0.3.5`. SemVer covers the rest.

### ACTIVE WORK — iOS 27, resume here (June 2026)
Implementing iOS 27 by **learn-by-building** against the real SDK. Done so far
on `xcode27`: hard gate cleared; SDK read directly (the `.swiftinterface` is
the source of truth — see `docs/iOS27-Design.md` §8); high-priority open
questions answered; **`PrivateCloudComputeProvider`** built, wired, unit-tested,
and **validated live on the M2 host (macOS 27) with the entitlement assigned**;
demos restructured to one signed Xcode app per platform (`iOSDemo` + new
`macOSDemo`), PCC opt-in; public README documents the PCC entitlement.

Note on the earlier plan: it expected to scaffold `Examples/iOS27Demo` and
leave the core "clean," and to treat the PCC provider as a stub because Q1–Q4
"need a device." Reading the `.swiftinterface` made the API shape (incl. the
full quota/error surface) discoverable *by compiling*, so the PCC provider went
straight into the core target behind a type-level `@available` gate (the D14
end state). Only the runtime *values/behaviour* still need a device.

Next steps, in order:
1. **User-account OpenAI/Claude/Gemini** via the `LanguageModel` + `Executor`
   pattern (§8) — **FOUNDATION BUILT (xcode27, uncommitted demo + committed
   core `5e1ebdf`/`067ccf1`).** `CloudAccountLanguageModel` (one vendor-agnostic
   `LanguageModel` keyed by `CloudVendor`) drives the existing REST clients via
   `FoundationModelsTranscript.decompose`, honours per-call `generationOptions`,
   maps to `LanguageModelError` where faithful. `LanguageModelProvider` wraps a
   `LanguageModel` into the chain (via `LanguageModelSession`).
   `AIConfiguration.userAccounts`/`UserAccount` + `ProviderIdentifier.userAccount(_:)`
   wired into `buildProviders` at one `@available` gate; demo has a "Your
   accounts" section. **Auth:** credential is a per-call **token provider**
   (`UserAccount.token` / `CloudAccountLanguageModel.token`, static-key
   convenience kept) living on the model — off the hashable executor
   `Configuration` per 339; the shared `LanguageModelError` mapper is extracted
   (`ProviderError(_:)`). **OAuth is automated** by the new **`VoltaSDKAuth`**
   module (`OAuthAccount`: `ASWebAuthenticationSession` + PKCE + Keychain +
   silent refresh + granted-scope validation; `OAuthConfiguration` incl.
   `additionalAuthorizationParameters`; `UserAccount(oauth:)` bridge) — kept
   out of the headless core. The irreducible step stays the developer's: each
   app is its own registered OAuth client. **VALIDATED LIVE against Google**
   (July 2026, real client on the M2): sign-in → PKCE → token → Keychain all
   work. Key findings: `ASWebAuthenticationSession` calls its completion on a
   background XPC queue → a main-actor-inherited closure traps under Swift 6
   dynamic isolation (fixed: `nonisolated` completion factory); Google needs
   `access_type=offline` (else no refresh token) + `prompt=consent`; granular
   consent can under-grant → validated at sign-in (`scopesNotGranted`).
   **Gemini OAuth generation is provider-policy-gated:** `generativelanguage`
   rejects user tokens regardless of scopes; the accepting endpoint
   (`cloudcode-pa`, Gemini CLI's) is a private API not enable-able for
   third-party client projects — `GeminiProvider` now has the dual transport
   (key → Developer API, OAuth → Code Assist envelope) for contexts where it
   is available, and user-account Gemini generation otherwise = the user's API
   key. **Cross-vendor verdict (verified online, July 2026): the same policy
   holds for all three** — Anthropic restricts Claude Free/Pro/Max OAuth to its
   own products (sanctioned alternative: Agent SDK credits, i.e. *their* SDK);
   OpenAI's "Sign in with ChatGPT" is identity-only. The demo's connect flow is
   therefore **key-only** (sign-in removed; `VoltaSDKAuth` retained as
   general-purpose machinery, demo no longer depends on it).
   **The official vendor route is the vendor's own package** (Gemini via
   Google's Firebase SDK; Anthropic's `ClaudeForFoundationModels`, verified
   available: github.com/anthropics/ClaudeForFoundationModels, v0.1.0+,
   developer-billed via `.apiKey`/`.appAttest`/`.proxied` — user-subscription
   Claude is Agent-SDK-only, a different surface) — supported via the new
   public **`AIConfiguration.customModels`** plug-in point
   (`CustomLanguageModel` wraps any Apple `LanguageModel` into the chain; the
   internal `LanguageModelProvider` is existential-based; type-erased config
   storage keeps the iOS-27 type behind a gated accessor).
   **FRONT DOOR VALIDATED LIVE (August 2026, beta 27A5237l):** a
   user-connected Gemini account (API key via the connect sheet) answered in
   `macOSDemo` through the full path — chain → `LanguageModelProvider` →
   `LanguageModelSession` → the `CloudAccountLanguageModel` executor →
   transcript decompose → REST; the whole package also builds clean on the new
   beta (no SDK drift). Demo hook for vendor packages shipped:
   `DemoRootView.init(vendorPackageName:makeVendorModels:)` + an "Official
   vendor package" section; `macOSDemo` (deployment now macOS 27; iOSDemo
   still 26) wires `ClaudeForFoundationModels` behind `#if canImport`, **SPM
   dependency parked** (commented in project.yml, removed from pbxproj): beta
   version skew broke it in both directions (0.1.4 targets beta 3 — failed vs
   the June beta on `SamplingMode`, vs 27A5237l on `Transcript.CustomSegment`).
   Re-attach when Anthropic ships a matching release; the section lights up by
   itself. **Toolchain: beta 27A5237l at `~/Downloads/Xcode-beta.app`.**
   **Part 2 leftovers:** ~~real streaming~~ ✅ (D16, Aug 2026: SSE in all three
   REST clients, native session streaming elsewhere, executor forwards deltas —
   feeds the Part 2 article update); still to do: Claude-package live
   validation once re-attached, reasoning level, resolve the chain transcript
   round-trip. **Article (Part 2) FINALIZED (Aug 2026):**
   `docs/articles/bringing-cloud-models-front-door.md` (git-excluded) —
   published as a deliberate beta-season snapshot (framed as such in its
   header); to be updated as GA approaches (Claude-package live beat + GA
   re-verify of every §8-derived claim). The
   Utilities Chat-Completions `LanguageModel` (Q8) is still unchecked — proceeded
   hand-written.
2. ~~`preferred(_ need:) -> any LanguageModel` bridge~~ ✅ **shipped as
   `preferred()` (Aug 2026, xcode27, 78 tests/17 suites green).** Same chain
   walk as `resolveProvider()`; returns the winning provider's native
   `LanguageModel` via the new public `LanguageModelConvertible` capability
   (all five built-ins adopt it: on-device → `SystemLanguageModel.default` —
   confirmed conforming by compilation; PCC → entitled model, nil-gated;
   wrapped models → themselves; developer-key REST → `CloudAccountLanguageModel`
   over the same client). Per-need overload arrives with step 3's chains.
   **Part 3 build STARTED (Aug 2026):** the Dynamic Profiles API is read from
   the `.swiftinterface` and recorded in `docs/iOS27-Design.md` §8 (Profile
   leaf + `Instructions` + full modifier list + `SessionProperty` +
   `LanguageModelSession(profile:history:)` — the `history:` slot is D12's
   entry point). **Demo design settled (Sep 2026): ONE chat, TWO drivers** —
   the earlier standalone `ProfileBridgeSection` was replaced by a driver
   picker in the playground ("VoltaSDK chain" | "Dynamic Profile").
   `AIPlaygroundView` gained an optional app-supplied `PlaygroundEngine`
   (label + footnote + a `streamDetailed`-shaped closure); the demo's
   `ProfileEngine` builds a native profile per turn (`preferred()`
   re-resolved, D7) and replays the app-owned history into
   `LanguageModelSession(profile:history:)` via the now-PUBLIC
   `FoundationModelsTranscript.entries` (the D12↔profile glue). The same
   conversation survives switching drivers mid-thread — the demo proves the
   bridge AND transcript portability in one gesture, and the footnote states
   the honest trade (no mid-turn fallback under Apple's driver). Two Swift 6
   findings recorded (resolve-then-declare — `preferred()` is async,
   modifiers aren't; `sending profile:` rejects @MainActor-declared profiles
   → nonisolated helper). LIVE VALIDATION PENDING: run macOSDemo, converse
   on the chain driver, flip to "Dynamic Profile" mid-conversation, confirm
   the thread continues on the resolved model — that run is Part 3's proof
   beat. **Article (Part 3) DRAFTED (Sep 2026):**
   `docs/articles/feeding-dynamic-profiles.md` (git-excluded) — follows
   session 242; opens on Apple's sample reading models off an object named
   `orchestrator`; structure per the series (announced/changed/problems/
   limits). **FULL DRAFT (Sep 2026):** now carries everything from the
   Sep sessions — the two-phase resolution explainer, the two-doors table +
   hold-the-session recipe, the D7 amendment told as a problem-encountered
   (with the "unmeasured belief" honesty), D18, and the Evaluations segue in
   Next. The one placeholder: the limits bullet "the switch itself hasn't
   been watched yet" — replace with the proof sentence after the user's
   driver-switch run, like Part 2's "It answered".
3. ~~Per-need fallback chain~~ ✅ (D7, Sep 2026) — see roadmap item 7 for
   the full record; `ModelPreference` kept at 4 cases as planned. Bundled:
   D18 (`.log` disclosure default).
4. **Follow-up surfaced by §8:** generalize the D13 `contextSize` capability
   from sync `Int?` to an async read, so PCC/cloud models can join the
   proactive token pre-flight (today PCC opts out → reactive only).
5. **Deeper PCC runtime validation:** live answering is confirmed (via
   `Examples/macOSDemo`, signed with the granted entitlement). Still to observe
   on a device: real quota-exhaustion (`.quotaLimitReached` → `.rateLimited`
   mapping) and `serviceUnavailable`, then fold Q15 (dev vs prod quotas) and
   any Q12/Q13 findings into the design doc. Confirmed so far: `availability`/
   `quotaUsage` read fine *without* the entitlement, but the first `respond`
   traps if it's absent — hence the provider's `SecTask` self-gate.

Design decision recorded under D7 in `docs/iOS27-Design.md`, **amended
Sep 2026 (user decision):** `.largeContext` ranks on-device LAST (Apple cloud
→ external, window-sorted; on-device only as the final fallback) — its
consistency isn't trusted for long-context work. The reactive half survives:
the D13 pre-flight still skips any window the measured call exceeds. The
June "a hint must never cause a privacy crossing" rule is knowingly relaxed
for this one need (crossing is to `.appleCloud` first while PCC is
available); D18's logging makes any further crossing visible.

## 4. Core principles (one-liners; full rationale in the linked docs)

- **D1/D2** Feed Dynamic Profiles, never own "agent" — we do model resolution. *(27 design)*
- **D3** One stable API; iOS 27 lights up additively. *(27 design)*
- **D4** Developer key = AI included in the app's subscription. *(26 impl)*
- **D5** On-device is never assumed present. *(26 impl)*
- **D6** PCC = free tier with runtime-exhaustible quota → fallback must be runtime. *(27 design)*
- **D7** Per-call re-resolution + privacy threshold disclosure. *(both)*
- **D8** Type is `AIOrchestrator` (module/type shadowing). *(26 impl)*
- **D9** `resolveProvider()` is the primitive; `respond` is convenience. *(26 impl)*
- **D10** Privacy disclosure shipped in 26, not 27. *(26 impl)*
- **D11** UI optional by construction; core never imports SwiftUI. *(26 impl)*
- **D12** Stateless core, transcript-transparent: app owns history, every call self-contained. *(26 impl)*
- **D13** Token awareness as optional capability + orchestrator pre-flight. *(26 impl)*
- **D14** One package, three capability tiers — expression-level gates for 26.4, type-level gates for 27. *(27 design)*
- **D15** Vendor-agnostic developer key: OpenAI/Claude/Gemini in one slot, auto-detected; model name travels with the key. *(26 impl)*
- **D16** Streaming as an optional capability; fallback only until the first fragment — visible text is never retracted. *(26 impl)*
- **D17** Warm-session reuse: same provider + exact conversation continuation → reuse the session; verify, never assume. *(26 impl)*
- **D18** Privacy downgrades are logged by default (`.log`, unified log) — never silently invisible; `.silent` is an explicit opt-in. *(26 impl)*

## 5. Roadmap (ordered)

1. ~~Compile & green the tests~~ ✅
2. ~~Privacy disclosure~~ ✅ (D10)
3. ~~Streaming~~ ✅ (D16, Aug 2026, xcode27): `streamResponse`/`streamDetailed`
   on the orchestrator, optional `streamResponse` capability on `ModelProvider`
   (default = one buffered fragment), SSE in all three REST clients, native
   session streaming for on-device/PCC/wrapped models, executor forwards
   deltas, demo UI renders live. Design question settled as designed: fail
   before first fragment = fall through; fail mid-stream = surface.
   **VALIDATED LIVE, all mechanisms (Aug 2026, macOSDemo on the M2 host):**
   PCC streams (native session streaming end-to-end), and a connect-sheet
   Gemini account streams — which exercises SSE against real vendor bytes AND
   the full front-door round-trip (SSE → executor → generation channel →
   session snapshots → deltas) in one run. Follow-up fixes from that session:
   the developer key is now TRIMMED before vendor detection and use
   (`CloudVendor.detect` + `buildCloudProvider`), and **Google's new `AQ.`
   Auth key format is supported** (mid-2026 migration: AI Studio issues only
   `AQ.…` keys now; detection maps them to Gemini, the provider routes them
   to the Developer API like `AIza`, with a pre-first-fragment fallback to
   Code Assist as Bearer for accounts whose AQ keys the Developer API still
   rejects — the observed-live acceptance path).
   **Aug 26, 2026 — Gemini model + thinking-budget fix** (adopter-reported):
   Google retired `gemini-2.5-flash` for new accounts, so `CloudVendor`'s
   Gemini default is now `gemini-3.6-flash`; and because thinking tokens are
   spent against `maxOutputTokens`, the 1000-token default produced textless
   answers (`finishReason: MAX_TOKENS`) that surfaced as "empty response".
   The provider now adds thinking headroom, joins all non-`thought` parts,
   and names the cause of any textless answer. See `docs/iOS26-Implementation.md`
   (`GeminiProvider`, D15).
   Note: the PCC entitlement wiring
   (CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS in the demo pbxproj) is a deliberately
   UNCOMMITTED local change — the committed project stays entitlement-free
   (opt-in policy); re-apply after any checkout/regenerate of the project.
4. ~~Token/context awareness~~ ✅ (D13)
5. ~~Multi-turn~~ ✅ (D12); ~~session/KV reuse when the provider didn't
   change~~ ✅ (D17, Sep 2026): session-backed providers each hold a
   `SessionCache` — reuse iff (instructions, history) exactly equals the
   conversation the warm session absorbed; miss = rebuild (pre-D17
   behaviour); errored/empty turns never re-enter; checkOut is exclusive.
   Removes the growing time-to-first-token tax vs a natively held Apple
   session in the common case (provider stable); the replay at a real model
   switch is unavoidable physics (no cross-model KV migration, Q6/Q7).
   Still open, lower priority: a trimming hook paired with `contextUsage`.
6. **iOS 27 providers** — PCC ✅ (xcode27, structural; runtime unverified);
   user-account Gemini/Claude next via the `LanguageModel`+`Executor` pattern
   (`docs/iOS27-Design.md` §6/§8). Was blocked; SDK now in hand.
7. ~~Per-need fallback chain~~ ✅ (D7 implemented, Sep 2026, 89 tests/19
   suites): public `ModelNeed` (`.lightweight/.reasoning/.largeContext`) as a
   `need:` parameter on respond/stream/resolve/`preferred(_:)` — a per-call
   hint that REORDERS the chain (stable sort by privacy-level tier:
   lightweight = onDevice→appleCloud→external; reasoning AND largeContext =
   appleCloud→external→onDevice — **largeContext amended Sep 2026, user
   decision: on-device LAST**, its consistency isn't trusted for long-context
   work; window-sorted within tiers; the D13 pre-flight still guards every
   window reactively — verified by test). `ModelPreference` stays at 4
   cases. `providerStatuses(for: need)` previews the reordered chain (shown
   live in the playground under the need picker). Bundled D18:
   `PrivacyDisclosure.log` (unified log, subsystem "VoltaSDK") is the new
   DEFAULT — silent fallback was criticism 4 of the Sep 2026 self-audit.
8. ~~`preferred()` bridge~~ ✅ (Aug 2026, xcode27): returns the resolved
   provider's native `any LanguageModel` via the public
   `LanguageModelConvertible` capability (all five built-ins adopt it);
   feedable to `.model(_:)` / `LanguageModelSession(model:)`. Per-need
   overload lands with 7; live Dynamic-Profile validation = Part 3's build.
9. ~~Model picker component~~ ✅ (June 2026): `ModelSelector` in VoltaSDKUI —
   collapsed user-side picker; selection answered by the app with
   `.activate`/`.deny`/`.deferred` (deferred = app-owned flow commits later
   via the binding — the iOS 27 OAuth-page pattern). Gate invariant: nothing
   commits without `onSelection` — auto-selects the best available **gate-free**
   provider (on-device, or PCC when on-device is off/unavailable; `isGateFree`
   = `{.onDevice, .privateCloudCompute}`), in chain order; gated providers
   (developer-key, user-account) are never preselected. iOS 27 providers appear
   automatically once wired into `buildProviders`; PCC has a default label.
10. **Fetch model lists from vendor APIs** (OpenAI/Anthropic `GET /v1/models`,
    Gemini `ListModels`): once a key is entered, populate a model picker for
    the developer instead of a free-text field. Complements D15.
11. **Evaluations framework (user decision, Sep 2026 — the next build after
    the Part 3 article).** Apple's WWDC 2026 Evaluations framework, three
    sessions: 298 "Meet the Evaluations framework" (probabilistic testing,
    metrics, evaluators, Swift Testing integration), 299 "Create robust
    evaluations for agentic apps" (`makeSamples` synthetic data,
    `TrajectoryExpectation`, `ToolCallEvaluator`), 335 "Improve your prompts
    by hill-climbing" (iterative refinement, judge-to-human drift via
    Cohen's kappa). Why it's OURS to build: the chain's promises are
    currently unmeasured — parity on fallback (open questions Q12/Q13:
    does quality hold when the answer silently moves providers?), and the
    D7-amendment doubt itself (is on-device *actually* unreliable at long
    context, and where's the threshold?). Evals turn both from beliefs into
    numbers, per provider, per need — potentially even informing chain
    ordering with measured data instead of tier heuristics. Likely Part 4
    of the article series.
